# Systems Bioengineering
Introductory course on mathematical and computational modeling of biological processes.
Utilizing experimental data to validate the constructed models.

### Logical Differential Equations (LDE)
LDE is a way to easily construct a system of differential equations from a logical network.
It is very similar to boolean and fuzzy logic networks.
We use LDEs to construct a model of a cell signalling network.
We model insulin signaling and glucose uptake [1] and compare how model parameters affect glucose uptake.
This can help us better understand mechanisms for insulin resistance and effectiveness, 
specifically for applications in diabetes.
